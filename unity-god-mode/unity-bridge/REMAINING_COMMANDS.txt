Due to context limits, I'm providing a summary. To complete all 142 commands:

PHASE 2 (35 commands) - Added to switch statement

**Strategy for completing:**
1. Current: 65 commands fully implemented (30 Phase 1 + 35 Phase 2 cases)
2. Remaining: 77 commands need implementation
3. Approach: Use compact, minimal code for each

**Remaining 77 Commands to implement:**
- Terrain operations (5)
- NavMesh operations (4)
- Advanced mesh operations (5)
- Editor settings (6)
